    <h1>Zaire's Kitchadi Soup Recipe</h1>
      <p>This is ayuveda recipe that I learned about through a ayuveda recipe book. I think of it like an ayuveda version of chicken noodle soup, since it's great to eat when you're feeling sick.</p>
    <h3>Mixing spices for the curry</h3>
      <p>Gather and mix these spices into a bowl before you add them to your soup. <span>Make sure to set the ghee aside until you're ready to heat your pot and add these spices.</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 Tbs. ghee</li>
        <li>1 Tbs. cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 Tbs. tumeric</li>
